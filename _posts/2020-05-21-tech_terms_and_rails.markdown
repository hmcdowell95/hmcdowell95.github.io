One thing I need to work on is my terminology, so I've been told. I'm going to do my best to jump this hurdle because English was my worst subject in high school. I was in remedial English for most of my education, but just like how I worked hard to get out of remedial english at the start of high school. I will do better at this, because I did get out of remedial English. 

Rails looks new and exciting so for but setting up WSL is frustrating and slightly discourging but while getting help with WSL I learned it isn't that easy for others as well. You just have to keep trying and use all the tools you have and anything is possible. Like, learning that implicit rendering is nicer and cleaner than explicit rendering. Explicit, you have to call out render and the file name of the view you want. Implicit, all you have to do is make sure the view file is the same new as the controller action.
