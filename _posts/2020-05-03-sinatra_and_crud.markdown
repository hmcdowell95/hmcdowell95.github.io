Sinatra has been new and more challanging than Object Orientation. Taking Object Orientation and using it in Sinatra has been no small task. Between ORM and HTML it has been a lot to take in. I can't really say one thing in particular has been challanging but CRUD did take a second to get use to. Many different routes to keep track of.
