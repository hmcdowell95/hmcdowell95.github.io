For my final project I choose to make a CLI app that shows you movies that are in threatres now. My first thought was to pull from AMC but there website structure had a lot of layers and it was complex. I struggled with that the most and then IMDb saved me. There data was easier to find and they gave me a good idea for the application. The first 6 movies are movies coming out this week and the last 10 are the top movies out now. Through AMC and IMBd it took awhile to get my scraping right. I learned that there are a few different ways to grab data.
