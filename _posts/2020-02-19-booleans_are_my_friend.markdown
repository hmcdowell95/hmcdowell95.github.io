I don't remember what exactly happened while learning booleans. I do however remember a few times where ".include?" helped me out. I guess I just like the logic behind it. It basically says "does this array include this?". I have used it a lot in if statements. I remember I was working on a lab and I had to make a method that checked if the element was there if not add the element. So I said if array.include?(x) == true then nothing because its there, else add the element to the array with the boolean <<.
