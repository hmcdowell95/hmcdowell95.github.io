While I was working on my Sinatra project I had no trouble with using session and secure password for log in and logout. Nor was it using CRUD except for patch, patch wasn't working right so I used post to update. What was the real struggle was HTML. One element of my class was a info box, so I had to really do some research in w3 to find textarea. My main worry was that it wasn't going to save to the database but it did! So I was happy to figure that out and learn something new. Also, playing with CSS was fun and educational. Wish I had a little more time to play with it.
