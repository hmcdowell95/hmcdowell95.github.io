Don't get me wrong data structures are important, but they are difficult at first. I think the first thing to understand is the difference between keys and values. Also note that booleans are harder to use with hashes because you can only use them on arrays inside your hash. For the hash itself it's mostly calling =, to change keys and other parts of your hash. Values are usually arrays and those are a little nicer to work with. You just have to know how to navigate through your data structure to build and change it the way you want.
